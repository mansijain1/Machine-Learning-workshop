Customer Churn Prediction & CO₂ Emissions Estimation
This repository demonstrates full-cycle machine learning workflows for two real-world use cases:
Both projects include data loading, preprocessing, EDA, model building, evaluation, and are organized with best practices for reproducibility.

1. - Classification: Predicting telecom customer churn
     
  A telecom provider wants to identify customers who are at risk of churning so they can take preventive actions.

Dataset
Name: Telco Customer Churn
Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn/data

Key Steps
- Load & inspect data
- Clean missing/invalid entries
- Encode categorical variables (e.g., gender, contract type)
- Scale numerical features
- Train models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest)

Evaluate using:

- Accuracy
- Precision / Recall / F1-Score
- Confusion Matrix
- ROC Curve

2. -  Regression: Estimating vehicle CO₂ emissions

     Predict CO₂ emissions of vehicles using features like engine size, fuel type, and consumption stats.

 Dataset
Name: CO₂ Emissions (Canada)
Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/debajyotipodder/co2-emission-by-vehicles

 Key Steps
- Load and explore the data
- Perform EDA: scatter plots, distributions, correlation heatmaps
- Handle categorical and numeric features appropriately
- Train regression models (e.g., Linear Regression)

Evaluate with:

- MAE, MSE, RMSE
- R² Score
- Residual and Prediction vs Actual plots
